      <description>Well the first blog post on here was with a specific goal, a specific format, one that is quite commonplace around the end of year on social media. Now here&amp;rsquo;s me going off the rails, free form, just typing directly on a .md file in VS Code! Look at me go!
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using some software called Obsidian a lot lately, which is a note-taking application that is essentially a neat and handy way to organize pages of notes (mainly - though you can do a pretty insane amount of other things), and for me lately notes have been in the form of daily journaling, taking notes on what I am reading, and essentially making a personal Wikipedia of everything I know and would like to know more about (the whole &amp;ldquo;second brain&amp;rdquo; aspect of it that everyone talks about).</description>

      <description>5 movies, 5 albums, 5 books that you get an unasked opinion about, for free! What a deal. With this list and website I guess I am essentially combining two things I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a lot of this year, especially quite recently: tech-tinkering and journaling. So I guess here you have a more focused, public version of a journal entry of mine, that required a lot of GitHub commits in order to appear before your face.</description>
